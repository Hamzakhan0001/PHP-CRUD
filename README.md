PHP CRUD
Project Title: PHP CRUD Application

This project demonstrates a basic CRUD application using PHP and MySQL, run locally on the XAMPP server. The application allows users to manage data through a user-friendly interface. The CRUD operations include:

Create: Add new records to the database.
Read: Display records from the database in a tabular format.
Update: Edit existing records in the database.
Delete: Remove unwanted records from the database.
Features:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, (Optional: Bootstrap for design).
Backend: PHP.
Database: MySQL (via phpMyAdmin in XAMPP).
Server: XAMPP as a local development server.
How It Works:

Create: A form collects user input and saves it into the database using a PHP script.
Read: Records from the database are retrieved and displayed in an HTML table.
Update: Users can edit records by selecting them and updating their details in a form.
Delete: Users can remove records by clicking a delete button.
Use Case Example: A user wants to manage a list of students. They can:

Add new students with details like name, age, and grade.
View all student records.
Update a student's details.
Delete a student no longer in the list.
